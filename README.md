LaTeX-Templates
===============
Various LaTeX templates. The homework template is based on
[this one](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckingsf/class/02-714/hw-template.tex) by Carl
Kingsford. There is no BibTeX template because bibliographies are easier to
make using programs such as [BibDesk](http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net).
